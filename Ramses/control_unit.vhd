-- 
-- Ramses's control unit
-- 
-- That control unit manages the entire processor, i.e., it sends all signals that are
-- needed to update registers, condition codes, read & write memory signals and so on.
--
-- The instructions that come from decoder unit can be divided in 3 categories:
-- 	1ยบ) Logic instructions that are performed over the registers, ie, they don't access
-- 		 the memory to execute the instruction since the data is already in the register.
--			 These instructions are NOT, NEG & SHR.
--		2ยบ) Logic and arithmetic instructions that are performed over one register and one memory address.
--			 These kind of instructions need to access the memory. Due to the slow speed of the memory,
--			 one more cycle is needed until the data be ready on the MDR (memory data register).
--		3ยบ) Jump instructions need to access the memory since the control unit need to know to where the PC
--			 will point. These instructions can be conditional or unconditional, ie, depending on the condition
--			 code and the flag, the jump instruction can become a NOP instruction. The instructions are 
--			 JMP (unconditional jump), JN (jump on negative), JC (jump on carry), JZ (jump on zero) and JSR ( 
--			 jump subroutine).
--
-- The control unit receives the instruction that are going to be done, if it is valid, and sends all signals.
-- Besides that, the control unit also receives the clock (to change its state since it's a FSM), reset signal
--	(signal that clear the machine such as PC, and so on), the register that is going to be used, since the register
-- data may be changed by instructions and the address method, the fundamental part of control unit.
--
-- The control unit analyses which address mode is used, since it specifies where is the operand. The adress method
-- also control how many cycles an instruction will take to be performed due to number of memory accesses.
